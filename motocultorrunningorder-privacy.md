## Running Order for Motocultor : Privacy policy

Welcome to the Running Order for Motocultor app for Android! This is an Android app developed by myself, Draynam, on my spare time.

I hereby state that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.

All data (social connections, band ratings, attendances) created by you (the user) is stored 
- by default, on your device only
- once you have logged in, in a cloud database hosted by google (Firestore) and to which only I have access

That cloud database is also used to host and sync the data of Motocultor editions, bands and gigs. 

### Account deletion

If you wish to delete your data, please request this deletion by sending me an email at draynam.dev@gmail.com.

I will then proceed to the deletion and advise you when it is done.
